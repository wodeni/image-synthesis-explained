  A <Cat /> wants to go to a <Dog />
  -only Halloween party, so she went to the sorceress for help. The sorceress specializes
  in magically generating
  <Dog />
  -looking cats. The key to getting into the party is to pass the <Dog />
  -ness inspection by another powerful sorceress, so the disguise has to be
  indistinguishable from other <Dog /> guests.
