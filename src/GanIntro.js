        At the beginning, the dog-looking cat is easily identified by the
        Diophantus, and the Gandalf need to improve the dog-look magic to make
        the cat looks more like a dog. After many many rounds of making dog look
        and identify fake dog, finally a dog-look cat get passed by the
        Diophantus.

        Thatâ€™s actually how GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) works.{" "}
        <strong>G</strong>andalf is the{" "}
        <i>
          <strong>G</strong>enerative Network
        </i>{" "}
        and <strong>D</strong>iophantus is the{" "}
        <i>
          <strong>D</strong>iscriminative Network
        </i>
        . And the final dog-look cat who get passed is the output of GAN. The
        generative network generates candidates and discriminative network
        evaluates them.
